"""Checks tools/lint/lint.sh: a clean superproject passes, with the fixture library and without any
library; each rule, planted alone, fails alone and names the file and the line; and
tools/lint/compile_commands.py lists what b2 builds, without what b2 expects to fail, plus the
aggregate translation units of each library: what builds only for WASI, the header of the fixture
library component_demo's world and its programs that declare no native target, is analysed as
wasi-sdk's clang++ builds it, with no host target, the header on wasip2 and on wasip3, each with
exceptions and without them; the fixture library browser_demo, whose headers no one target builds,
has an aggregate per target, its emscripten one analysed by wasi-sdk's clang++ with the words of
em++ --cflags, and its native one, against the fake dependency that throws, twinned without the
header that needs exceptions and with a native header whose own headers-alone call does not declare
them; a public header that no target compiles alone, a target whose toolset is not configured, and a
WebAssembly command whose compiler is neither wasi-sdk's clang++ nor, on emscripten, Emscripten's
em++, fail the database by name. Each case lints a scratch superproject whose libs/demo is the
fixture library demo, a repository of its own as a library's submodule is, and libs/component_demo
or libs/browser_demo too in the cases of WASI and of emscripten. Run with the names of some cases to
run only those."""
