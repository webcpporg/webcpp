"""Checks tools/lint/lint.sh: a clean superproject passes, with the fixture library and without
any library; each rule, planted alone, fails alone and names the file and the line; and
tools/lint/compile_commands.py lists what b2 builds, without what b2 expects to fail, plus the
aggregate translation units of each library: what builds only for WASI, the header of the fixture
library component_demo's world and its programs that declare no native target, is analysed as
wasi-sdk's clang++ builds it, with no host target, the header on wasip2 and on wasip3; a public
header that no target compiles alone, a target whose toolset is not configured, and a WebAssembly
command whose compiler is not wasi-sdk's clang++, fail the database by name. Each case lints a
scratch superproject whose libs/demo is the fixture library demo, a repository of its own as a
library's submodule is, and libs/component_demo too in the cases of WASI. Run with the names of
some cases to run only those."""
