# Working on webcpp

This is webcpp's rulebook. It is written for coding agents and human
contributors alike, and it holds every rule needed to port a library to
webcpp or to change one: an agent with no other context ports a library by
following it. Each library's own `AGENTS.md` (`libs/<name>/AGENTS.md`) holds
only what is specific to that library: the original and its version, how its
oracle drives the original, its particular cautions. Read this file first,
then the library's.

Three kinds of paragraph mark what is not in the tree yet, so that each can be
checked when it lands:

- **Pending (Task 11):** the CI, `.github/workflows/` and `tools/ci/`, as
  stage 1's plan defines it. The commands it runs are in the tree and work
  today; the workflows that run them are not.
- **Pending (Task 12):** publishing. `libs/xactor` becomes a submodule when
  its repository is published; until then it is a repository of its own
  inside the checkout, which the build and the lint already treat as a
  library.
- **Pending (stage 2):** the shared oracle, `tools/oracle/`, which stage 2
  generalises from xstate's.

Everything else describes the tree as it is. Every command below runs from
the superproject's root, in a shell where `CPATH`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` and
`C_INCLUDE_PATH` are unset (chapter 12).

## 1. What webcpp is

webcpp brings to C++ the libraries that are widely used for the web in other
languages. Each library is ported with the help of coding agents and proven
against the original. webcpp follows Boost's guidelines and model: the GitHub
organisation `webcpporg` is the equivalent of `boostorg`, and this
superproject, `webcpporg/webcpp`, is the equivalent of `boostorg/boost`. Every
library is header-only C++20, under the Boost Software License 1.0, in a
repository of its own, checked out here as a submodule under `libs/<name>`.

### The libraries

| Library | What it is | Targets | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| xactor | a deterministic actor system, webcpp's own | native, wasip2, wasip3 (`xactor_asio` native only) | in `libs/xactor`; the model for every port |
| xstate | a port of XState 5.33.2's state machines and actors; depends on xactor and Boost.JSON | native, wasip2, wasip3 | stage 2 |
| wasi | a helper for building C++ as WASI HTTP components | wasip2, wasip3 (`response.hpp` also natively) | stage 3 |
| trystero | a port of Trystero, serverless WebRTC rooms | native, emscripten | stage 4 |

```

A library has no Jamroot. It is developed inside a checkout of the
superproject, as a Boost library is developed inside Boost: the superproject's
Jamroot is its build configuration, and `libs/<name>` is its repository.

### Prerequisites

- Boost 1.92 or newer, installed;
- b2 (B2 5.5.3 is what stage 1 is built with);
- a C++20 compiler;
- Python 3.9 or newer;
- for WebAssembly: wasi-sdk 34 and wasmtime 47 (47.0.3 measured);
- for the documentation: Node, MrDocs 2026.9.29 and clang++;
- for the lint: wasi-sdk 34's clang-format and clang-tidy, and Node;
- later: Emscripten, wit-bindgen and the `wasi:http` WIT for wasi and
  trystero; OpenSSL for trystero natively.

Until stage 6 bundles the toolchains, each is configured in `user-config.jam`.
b2 reads `~/user-config.jam`, or the file `--user-config=<file>` names:

```
using clang ;      # or gcc, or msvc: the native toolset
using boost : 1.92 : <include>/opt/homebrew/opt/boost/include <library>/opt/homebrew/opt/boost/lib ;
local wasi-sdk = /path/to/wasi-sdk ;
using clang : wasip2 : $(wasi-sdk)/bin/clang++
  : <cflags>--target=wasm32-wasip2 <cxxflags>--target=wasm32-wasip2 <linkflags>--target=wasm32-wasip2
    <archiver>$(wasi-sdk)/bin/llvm-ar <ranlib>$(wasi-sdk)/bin/llvm-ranlib ;
using clang : wasip3 : $(wasi-sdk)/bin/clang++
  : <cflags>--target=wasm32-wasip3 <cxxflags>--target=wasm32-wasip3 <linkflags>--target=wasm32-wasip3
    <archiver>$(wasi-sdk)/bin/llvm-ar <ranlib>$(wasi-sdk)/bin/llvm-ranlib ;
```

When Boost cannot be used, the build stops before it compiles anything and
prints the exact `using boost` line to add.

**Machine-local setup.** `.local/` is git-ignored and holds what one machine
needs: `.local/user-config.jam`, `.local/wasi-sdk/` and `.local/mrdocs/`. The
tools look there first. `tools/lint/compile_commands.py` runs b2 with
`.local/user-config.jam`, else with the file `$WEBCPP_USER_CONFIG` names,
else with b2's own search. The tests of the build and of the tools read
`.local/user-config.jam`, else the file `$WEBCPP_USER_CONFIG` names, and stop
with an error when neither exists (`tools/test/harness.py`). The doc build
finds MrDocs at `.local/mrdocs/bin/mrdocs`. b2 itself reads it only when told:
`b2 --user-config=.local/user-config.jam ...`.

### The build commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `b2 test` | every library's tests, natively |
| `b2 example` | every library's examples: each is built, run, and its output compared with its `.expected` |
| `b2 doc` | the index page, `doc/html/index.html`, and every library's page, `libs/<name>/doc/html/index.html` |
| `b2 libs/<name>/test` | one library's tests; `libs/<name>/example` and `libs/<name>/doc` likewise |
| `b2 libs/<name>/test//<test>` | one test, while working on it (`scheduler`, `scheduler-noexcept`) |
| `b2 libs/<name>/doc//reference` | one library's API reference alone, MrDocs strict |
| `b2 toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime libs/<name>/test libs/<name>/example` | the same for wasm32-wasip2; `clang-wasip3` for wasm32-wasip3; one toolset per command |
| `b2 install --prefix=<dir>` | copies every library's headers to `<dir>/include/webcpp/` |
| `b2 declared-targets -d0` | prints each `<library> <target>` pair the libraries declare: the CI's lanes |
| `b2 -a ...` | any of these from scratch; the only build that counts as evidence |
| `tools/lint/lint.sh --clang-format <wasi-sdk>/bin/clang-format --clang-tidy <wasi-sdk>/bin/clang-tidy` | the lint, of the superproject and every library (chapter 6) |
| `python3 tools/<dir>/<name>_test.py` | a test of the build or of a tool (chapter 10) |

## 2. Choosing and registering a port

### Choosing

- **What.** A library widely used for the web in another language, ported at
  an exact version of the original: a tag or a published release, recorded in
  `meta/libraries.json` and in the library's `AGENTS.md`. A port follows that
  version; moving to another one is a change of its own, with its evidence.
- **The licence.** An original under a licence compatible with BSL-1.0 can be
  ported: MIT, BSD and Apache-2.0. GPL cannot. MPL is decided case by case,
  by the owner. A port that derives from the original's code keeps the
  original's notice, unchanged, in `LICENSE-<ORIGIN>.txt` (`LICENSE-XSTATE.txt`,
  `LICENSE-TRYSTERO.txt`), and its README names the parts that derive from
  it. That adds no licence to webcpp's code: every file of webcpp is BSL-1.0
  only, and no repository has a `LICENSE-MIT.txt`. A library of webcpp's own,
  like xactor, has no `LICENSE-<ORIGIN>.txt`.
- **The name.** `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*`, the name of the original where it has one
  (xstate, trystero). `index` is reserved, in any case: the index page is the
  doc build's page `index`, and the report refuses a library of that name.

### The checklist of a new library

Each item is done before the port's first green CI; the first two are the
owner's:

1. **The repository** `webcpporg/<name>`, public from its first commit, made
   by the owner. An agent never creates a remote repository, never pushes,
   and never changes a GitHub setting. Until the repository exists, the
   library is a local repository at `libs/<name>` (`git init`), which the
   lint and the build already treat as a library.
2. **The submodule**, added by the owner once the repository exists:

   ```
   git submodule add https://github.com/webcpporg/<name> libs/<name>
   ```

   Never `git add -A` or `git add libs` in the superproject: a library is a
   repository of its own, and the superproject records only its commit.
3. **`meta/libraries.json`**, Boost's file, with webcpp's `"port-of"`:

   ```json
   {
       "key": "xstate",
       "name": "xstate",
       "authors": ["Rodrigo"],
       "description": "One sentence that says what the library is.",
       "category": ["State"],
       "maintainers": ["Rodrigo <pinhopro@proton.me>"],
       "cxxstd": "20",
       "port-of": {
           "name": "XState",
           "language": "TypeScript",
           "version": "5.33.2",
           "url": "https://github.com/statelyai/xstate",
           "licence": "MIT"
       }
   }
   ```

   `"port-of"` is `null` for a library of webcpp's own (xactor's is). `name`,
   `description` and `port-of` are required, and every field of `port-of`,
   whose `url` is an `https` URL; `tools/doc/libraries.py` fails the doc build,
   naming the file and the field, otherwise.
4. **`build.jam`**, which the Jamroot finds by its glob `libs/*/build.jam` and
   registers as `/webcpp/<name>`. It declares one target, named after the
   library, that adds its headers and its dependencies:

   ```
   # Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
   # ... the licence notice (chapter 11)

   project /webcpp/<name> ;

   alias <name> : : : : <include>include <library>/boost//headers ;
   ```

   A dependency on another library is written as its target,
   `<library>/webcpp/xactor//xactor`; on a compiled Boost library, as Boost's
   target, `<library>/boost//json`. Nothing else registers a library: the
   test, example and doc directories join the aggregates `test`, `example` and
   `doc` by themselves, and `include/webcpp/**` joins `install`.
5. **`test/Jamfile`, `example/Jamfile` and `doc/Jamfile`**, with the rules of
   chapter 9 and chapter 8.
6. **The files of the repository:** `LICENSE_1_0.txt`, `README.md` (what the
   library is, how to build and test it inside the superproject, where its
   page is published, its licence), `AGENTS.md` (only what is specific to it,
   with a link to this file as `../../AGENTS.md`), `.gitattributes`, and a
   `.gitignore` that holds at least `doc/html/`: the superproject's own
   `.gitignore` names only its top-level `doc/html/`.
7. **CI.** Pending (Task 11): `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which calls the
   superproject's reusable workflow:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     ci:
       uses: webcpporg/webcpp/.github/workflows/library.yml@main
       with:
         library: <name>
   ```

8. **The index page.** It lists every library of `libs/` from its
   `meta/libraries.json`, so the entry exists once the file does, and `b2 doc`
   shows it in `doc/html/index.html`, linked to the library's page. A library
   without a page fails the index.
9. **`LICENSE-<ORIGIN>.txt`**, where the port derives from the original's
   code (above).

## 3. Names

| What | Rule | xactor's |
| --- | --- | --- |
| namespace | `webcpp::<name>` | `webcpp::xactor` |
| what is not public | a namespace `detail`, at any depth | `webcpp::xactor::detail` |
| convenience header | `<webcpp/<name>.hpp>`, which includes every public header | `<webcpp/xactor.hpp>` |
| headers | `<webcpp/<name>/...>`, one per responsibility, `snake_case` | `<webcpp/xactor/scheduler.hpp>` |
| macros | `WEBCPP_<NAME>_*` | `WEBCPP_XACTOR_*` |
| test-only macros | `WEBCPP_TEST_*` | |
| include guards | `WEBCPP_<NAME>_<HEADER>_HPP` | `WEBCPP_XACTOR_ACTOR_LOGIC_HPP` |
| b2 target | `/webcpp/<name>//<name>` | `/webcpp/xactor//xactor` |
| error category | `webcpp.<name>` | `webcpp.xactor` |
| identifiers | `snake_case`, Boost's convention; `.clang-tidy` enforces it | |

A test's helpers that are shared between tests go in `webcpp::test`
(`libs/xactor/test/require.hpp`). Example programs alias the namespace
(`namespace xactor = webcpp::xactor;`), as Boost's do.

## 4. Fidelity

- A port behaves as the original, at the version it ports: the same results,
  the same order of events, the same errors, for the same inputs.
- Every difference is a decision, recorded in the page's appendix
  "Differences": what the original does, what the port does, and why. A
  difference forced by C++ (no garbage collector, no exceptions on wasip2,
  value types where the original shares objects) is still recorded.
- Each difference has an example `example/diff_<topic>.cpp`, with its
  `.expected`, and its twin in the original's language (chapter 5), which
  shows the original's behaviour; the page shows both outputs side by side.
  Stage 2 brings the model, xstate's `diff_spawn_id`: XState keys a child
  spawned without an id as `"undefined"`, the port as an empty string, and
  the page shows the two outputs, each printed by its program.
- No divergence goes unrecorded. A difference found later, in a test, a
  review or a user's report, is either fixed or recorded in the same change
  that finds it.

## 5. Evidence: oracle and twins

Pending (stage 2): `tools/oracle/` does not exist yet. xstate is its first
user, and these are the rules it implements. Until then, a port's evidence is
its tests, and its page records what it does.

The oracle is shared by every port:

| Shared, in `tools/oracle/` | Per library |
| --- | --- |
| the twin runner, with its agreeing, divergent and without-twin bookkeeping | the pinned original (`package.json` and `package-lock.json`, for JavaScript) |
| output and tree comparison | the oracle script that drives the original over the cases |
| `update-expected`, with its refusals | the cases, and their C++ runner |
| a `.jam` module of rules that the library's test Jamfile calls | the twins |
| the CI action that installs the language's runtime | |

- **Cases.** The original's tests are ported as data-driven cases, which the
  C++ runner runs against the port.
- **Expected results.** The oracle runs the pinned original over the same
  cases and writes the expected results. The port must produce them.
- **Twins.** Every documented example has a twin in the original's language,
  `<name>.mjs` beside the C++ program in the library's twin directory, which
  the page includes through `{twins}`. A twin either agrees (prints exactly
  what the C++ example prints), or diverges, with the original's output
  recorded as its own `.expected` and the difference in the appendix
  (chapter 4), or is listed as without a twin, with the reason.
- **Nothing expected is written by hand.** Only `update-expected` writes an
  expected result, and it refuses to write a twin's output for a twin that
  agrees, since that output must be the C++ example's.
- **How the original runs.** Each library declares it: for JavaScript and
  TypeScript, `node --conditions=development`.

## 6. C++ rules

### The language

- C++20, header-only. The Jamroot sets `<cxxstd>20`, `<warnings>extra` and
  `<warnings-as-errors>on` for everything.
- Boost and the standard library before custom code. A third-party
  dependency other than Boost needs the owner's decision.
- **Errors as values.** An operation that can fail returns its error:
  `boost::system::result<T>`, with an error category of the library's own
  (`webcpp.<name>`) and fixed enumerator values that are never reused.
- **No global or static mutable state.** `.clang-tidy` enforces part of it
  (`cppcoreguidelines-avoid-non-const-global-variables`).
- **Determinism.** No clock, file, network, process, thread, environment or
  entropy, unless that is the library's purpose. The lint's world rule finds
  them by name in every library header; a line that names one without
  reaching the world (a simulated clock), or that reaches it because it is the
  library's purpose, says why after `lint-world:` on the same line:

  ```cpp
  #include <boost/asio/io_context.hpp>  // lint-world: posts handlers only
  ```

- **Text** is passed and held as `std::string_view` where nothing must own
  it; `std::string` only where something does.
- **A function starts with its guards:** every condition it needs is checked
  first, and what fails returns there, before any work begins.
- **A comment says what the code does not make clear:** why, a constraint, an
  example of a value. A descriptive comment is one sentence of what the code
  that follows does, then an optional reason, in a few lines.
- **JSON literals in code are laid out for their reader:** a raw string
  literal that opens a line with `R"({` or `R"([` has its members four spaces
  deeper than that line, one per line, and closes at that line's indentation.

### Exceptions and RTTI

- **wasip2:** a program compiles without exceptions. The Jamroot sets
  `<exception-handling>off` and `BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS` for `clang-wasip2`, and
  `webcpp.jam` links `tools/throw_exception.cpp`, a `boost::throw_exception`
  handler that prints and aborts, into every program built without
  exceptions.
- **wasip3:** exceptions are on. The Jamroot compiles with
  `-fwasm-exceptions -mllvm -wasm-use-legacy-eh=false` and links with
  `-fwasm-exceptions -lunwind`. The second flag is needed: wasi-sdk 34 emits
  the legacy encoding by default, which wasmtime 47 refuses to run
  ("legacy_exceptions feature required").
- **Natively,** every `webcpp.run` test also runs as `<name>-noexcept`,
  without exceptions and without RTTI (`<exception-handling>off <rtti>off
  BOOST_NO_EXCEPTIONS`), which proves the library works for a user who
  disables both.
- So a library's headers never `throw`, `try` or `catch` where wasip2 or the
  `-noexcept` variant reaches them: they return errors, and a failure that
  cannot be returned goes through `boost::throw_exception`. A program that
  throws on purpose declares only the targets where exceptions are on:
  `webcpp.example catches.cpp : : native wasip3 ;` (an example has no
  `-noexcept` variant).
- RTTI is never restricted by webcpp; a user imposes their own.

### What the lint enforces

`tools/lint/lint.sh` lints the superproject and every library of `libs/` that
is a repository: what git tracks and what it would track (untracked, not
ignored), so a new file is linted before it is added. It prints each rule's
section and ends with `lint: clean`, or with `lint: failed: <rule>` for each
rule that failed.

| Rule | What fails |
| --- | --- |
| clang-format | a C++ file not formatted as `.clang-format` says (Google-based, 4 spaces, 100 columns); `clang-format -i` fixes it |
| clang-tidy | a finding of `.clang-tidy` (every warning is an error) in the compilation database `tools/lint/compile_commands.py` writes from b2's dry run: every test and example natively, plus one aggregate translation unit per library that includes every public header (`bin/aggregate/<name>.cpp`) |
| io_context::run | a call of Boost.Asio's `run`, `run_one` or `run_for`, which block; a driver drains with `poll` and `poll_one` |
| fluent chains | three calls chained in one expression |
| returns `*this` | a function other than an assignment operator returning `*this` |
| em dash | U+2014 in any file |
| JSON literals | a raw JSON literal laid out otherwise than chapter 6 says |
| licence notice | a source file that does not open with the notice (chapter 11) |
| banned word | the word that the pattern `veru[s]` matches, in any case, in a file, a file name or a commit (its author, committer or message) of any repository |
| no clock, disk or network | a library header that names a clock, a file, a socket, a process, a thread, the environment or entropy without `lint-world:` |
| raw b2 rules | `run`, `run-fail`, `compile`, `compile-fail`, `exe` or `unit-test` in a library's test or example Jamfile (chapter 9) |
| Doc Comments | a command webcpp does not allow, a bare `@`, or a colon after a reference (chapter 7) |
| Pyright | an error or a warning in any Python file, with `pyrightconfig.json` (unused imports and variables are errors) |
| Python line length | a Python line over 100 columns |

A source b2 expects not to compile (`webcpp.compile-fail`) is left out of
clang-tidy only; every other rule reads it.

**A directory's own `.clang-tidy`.** A library's tests or examples may need
one that inherits the root's (`InheritParentConfig: true`) and switches off
what does not apply to them, each with its reason in a comment. xactor's
`test/.clang-tidy` turns off `bugprone-unchecked-optional-access` (a test
asserts with `BOOST_TEST` before it reads, which the check does not see) and
`bugprone-exception-escape.CheckMain` (a test's `main` lets an exception end
the process, which fails the test as it should); `example/.clang-tidy` turns
off the second. The library's headers are still analysed with every check,
through the aggregate translation unit.

**Sharding.** `--shard K/N` analyses the K-th of N interleaved slices with
clang-tidy, and runs every other rule; the N shards together analyse every
file once.

## 7. Doc Comments and the API reference

### Generation

The reference is generated by MrDocs 2026.9.29, always to AsciiDoc and as a
single page, from the library's Doc Comments. `webcpp.reference <name> ;` in
`doc/Jamfile` declares it; `tools/doc/reference.py` runs it:

- the input is a compilation database of one aggregate translation unit,
  which includes every public header (the same one the lint analyses);
- the shared settings are `tools/doc/mrdocs.yml.in`: `generator: adoc`,
  `multipage: false`, `embedded: true`, `warn-as-error: true`,
  `auto-function-metadata: false`, `auto-relates: false`, every `warn-*` on,
  the symbols of `webcpp::<name>::**`, `detail` namespaces as
  implementation-defined, the macros `WEBCPP_<NAME>_*` except the include
  guards, and `base-url: https://github.com/webcpporg/<name>/blob/main/`;
- `tools/doc/doc_comments.py` then checks with clang++ what MrDocs does not
  (below);
- the page includes the result with
  `include::{reference}[leveloffset=+1]`.

`auto-function-metadata` and `auto-relates` are off because, at their
defaults, they document a parameter with its type's brief and count a class
with related functions as documented, which hid 48 findings on the first
library measured.

**A library's `doc/mrdocs.yml` holds presentation keys only.** It may set
`sort-members`, `sort-members-by`, `sort-namespace-members-by`,
`sort-members-ctors-1st`, `sort-members-dtors-1st`,
`sort-members-assignment-1st`, `sort-members-conversion-last`,
`sort-members-relational-last`, `overloads`, `sfinae`,
`inherit-base-members`, `inherit-hidden-friends`, `legible-names` and
`show-enum-constants`. Any other key (what is documented, the input, the
output, a warning) is refused and fails the reference: every library is
documented as strictly as every other. xactor's sets `show-enum-constants:
true`.

### The format

Doc Comments are Javadoc/Doxygen style, `/** ... */`, before the symbol they
document:

```cpp
/**
 Handles one message, the payload of `cause`.

 The scheduler calls it once for each message delivered to the actor, and
 delivers the actor's next message only after it returns.

 @param turn What the actor may do while it handles the message.
 @param cause The message, in the envelope that says who sent it.
 @return Success, or an error of any category, which ends the actor with
 the status @ref status::error.
 @note An error ends this actor and only it.
 @see "Writing an actor logic", in the guide.
*/
virtual result<void> handle(xactor::turn<Message>& turn, const envelope<Message>& cause) = 0;
```

### What every public symbol needs

A public symbol is one at namespace scope of `webcpp::<name>`, or a public
member of a public class, outside every namespace `detail`. Every one is
fully documented: functions, classes, structs, enums and enumerators,
aliases, concepts, variables, data members and macros.

- **A brief,** the first paragraph, which is a single sentence: MrDocs makes
  the whole first paragraph the brief, and `doc_comments.py` fails a brief of
  more than one sentence (an abbreviation such as `e.g.` and a code span do
  not count).
- **`@param`** for every parameter, **`@tparam`** for every named template
  parameter (of a function, class, partial specialization, alias, variable or
  concept, hidden friends and member templates included), and **`@return`**
  for every function that returns a value. MrDocs reports a missing `@param`
  or `@return`; `doc_comments.py` reports a missing `@tparam`, which MrDocs
  does not.
- **A deleted function takes no `@return`.** Nobody can call it, so a
  `@return` would say nothing, and MrDocs accepts its absence:
  `actor_logic& operator=(const actor_logic&) = delete;` has a brief and no
  `@return`.
- **`@throws`, `@pre`, `@post`, `@note`, `@see` and `@code`** where they
  apply.
- **Each enumerator and each data member has its own Doc Comment.** clang
  attaches one comment to every declarator up to the next `;`, `{`, `}`, `#`
  or `@`, so in `/** A. */ a, b,` the enumerator `b` has `a`'s comment, and in
  `/** The x. */ int x, y;` so does `y`. `doc_comments.py` reports the second
  as undocumented, public or `detail`. Comment each one itself, and declare
  one data member per declaration.
- **A `detail` symbol** needs only its brief.

### The commands

- **Allowed:** `@brief`, `@param`, `@tparam`, `@return`, `@returns`,
  `@throws`, `@pre`, `@post`, `@note`, `@see`, `@code`/`@endcode`,
  `@details`, `@par`, `@copydoc`, `@ref` (and the same with `\`).
- **Forbidden,** because MrDocs drops them without a word: `@sa`,
  `@deprecated`, `@since`, `@todo`, `@retval`, and every other command. The
  lint names each.
- **A literal `@` in prose** is written `\@`; a bare `@` that starts no
  allowed command fails the lint.
- **No colon after `@ref x`.** MrDocs drops the colon: write
  `the result of @ref status_of, which`, never `@ref status_of: it`. The lint
  rejects it. A possessive is fine (`@ref scheduler's queue`); MrDocs renders
  it.
- **`@see "<title>"`** sends the reader to a section of the library's page by
  its title, exactly as the heading writes it after its `=` marks, in
  quotes, and on one line: `@see "Writing an actor logic", in the guide.` The
  doc build fails on a title that names no section of the page, or that
  wraps onto a second line, since MrDocs writes the title as plain text that
  no link checks. A section renamed changes its `@see` lines in the same
  commit.
- **A `(doc: #<anchor>)`** in a `//` comment of the library (code, test or
  example) sends its reader to an anchor of the page, such as a guarantee:
  `(doc: #xactor-invariant-13)`, or a list, `(doc: #a, #b and #c)`, or a
  range, `(doc: #a to #b)`. The doc build fails on an anchor that the page
  does not define. In a Doc Comment, use `@see` with the section's title.
- **Never link by hand to an overload's anchor:** MrDocs gives it a hash
  suffix that changes.
- **File-level comments do not reach the reference.** A header's opening
  `/** ... */` is for its reader; what the user needs is in the symbols'
  comments.

### What the doc build does after MrDocs

`postprocess.mjs` decodes the character references MrDocs writes for the
characters AsciiDoc would read as markup, and the U+2010 it writes for an
ASCII hyphen; `reference.py` drops the near-empty sections of the global
namespace and of `webcpp`, so the reference starts at `webcpp::<name>`, with
the library's macros, when it has any, in a section "Macros" of their own.

### Where the reference sits

It replaces any hand-written reference chapter. The numbered guarantees stay
in the guide part of the page, and a reference like `(doc: #anchor)` in a Doc
Comment becomes `@see "<title>"`.

## 8. Documentation

### The page

Each library has one AsciiDoc page, `doc/<name>.adoc`, with its sections in
files of their own beside it, built by `doc/Jamfile`:

```
import webcpp ;

webcpp.doc <name> : <name>.adoc ;
webcpp.reference <name> ;
```

Either rule declared in another directory stops the build, naming the rule
and the directory, and so does a page whose Jamfile declares no reference.
`b2 libs/<name>/doc` converts the page with Asciidoctor.js into
`libs/<name>/doc/html/index.html`, with the reference included. The page
sets its own title and attributes, as xactor's does:

```
= <name>: <what it is> for {cpp}
:toc: left
:toclevels: 1
:idprefix:
:sectanchors:
:example-caption!:
:attribute-missing: warn
```

The doc build provides `{examples}` (the library's `example/` directory) and
`{reference}`, and sets the highlighter, the shared style
(`tools/doc/docinfo.html`, the system's fonts, no web fonts), no date and no
footer: a page sets none of these.

**What a page holds:**

- **the guide,** taught the way the original's documentation teaches, concept
  by concept, with C++ only in listings: each concept's purpose, its smallest
  example, its variations and its rules. Each section has an anchor that
  starts with the library's name, `[#xactor-testing]`;
- **the guarantees,** numbered, each with an anchor named after its number,
  `. [[xactor-invariant-1]]The messages of one mailbox are handled in the
  order they were enqueued.` A guarantee keeps its number and its anchor
  forever, since code, tests and comments cite them;
- **a testing chapter:** how a program tests what it builds with the library,
  how the library itself is tested, on which targets, with which commands,
  and where the test matrix is (https://webcpporg.github.io/webcpp/report/);
- **the reference,** `include::{reference}[leveloffset=+1]`, under a section
  `[#reference]`;
- **the appendix "Differences"** for a port (chapter 4).

**Every listing is a compiled example, and every shown output comes from a
`.expected` file.** A listing includes a region of an example, marked in the
program by `// tag::<name>[]` and `// end::<name>[]` lines:

```
[source]
----
include::{examples}/xactor_quick_start.cpp[tag=messages,indent=0]
----
```

and the output it prints, which `b2 example` compares on every build:

```
[source]
----
include::{examples}/xactor_quick_start.expected[]
----
```

A listing of shell commands is `[source,bash]`; the only languages a page may
use are C++ (the default), JavaScript (a twin's code), JSON and bash.

### What doc-check enforces

`tools/doc/doc-check.py` runs before the page is converted, and again on the
rendered HTML; any finding, and any warning of Asciidoctor's, fails the
build:

- every `.adoc` under `doc/` is reached from the page's `include::` graph;
- every example's code or output is shown, every block's language is allowed,
  C++ is shown only as an include of an example, and the page includes the
  reference;
- every include names a file that exists, inside `doc/`, `{examples}` or
  `{twins}`; an output's include names a program that exists;
- every `(doc: #anchor)` and `index.html#anchor` of the library's files
  names an anchor the page defines, and every `@see "<title>"` a section;
- every C++ block of the library's README is opened by a comment
  `<!-- include::<file>[<attributes>] -->` and equals that region of the
  file, as an include would give it;
- no line inside a table starts with `//` (Asciidoctor drops it as a
  comment), and no `++` appears in prose (two of them swallow what lies
  between): write `{cpp}`;
- the rendered page has no cross-reference left as text, no stray `++` or
  backtick, no undecoded escape of MrDocs's, no U+2010, and no link to the
  dropped `#index` or `#webcpp` sections.

### The index page

`doc/index.adoc`, built by `doc/Jamfile` (`webcpp.index index.adoc ;`),
introduces webcpp and includes, at `{libraries}`, the table that
`tools/doc/libraries.py` writes from every library's `meta/libraries.json`:
its name, linked to its page, its description, and what it ports, linked to
the original. `b2 doc` builds it with every library's page.

**One doc build at a time.** A doc build writes `doc/html/` and
`libs/<name>/doc/html/` inside the tree, so two concurrent doc builds would
write the same files.

## 9. Tests, lanes, the report and CI

### Targets

A target is what a program is built for:

| Target | Toolset | Runs with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `native` | any toolset not below: gcc, clang, msvc, darwin | the host |
| `emscripten` | b2's `emscripten` | first used by trystero (stage 4) |
| `wasip2` | `clang-wasip2`, a clang registered against wasi-sdk with version `wasip2` | `testing.launcher=wasmtime` |
| `wasip3` | `clang-wasip3`, likewise | `testing.launcher=wasmtime` |

A Jamfile declares its default with `webcpp.targets`, a program can override
it with its own targets, and with no declaration a program is built for
`native` only. For any other target, the program gets `<build>no` and b2 skips
it without a word. This filter is conditioned on `<toolset>` and its version
only, never on a derived feature (chapter 12).

### The Jamfile API (`tools/webcpp.jam`)

A library's test and example Jamfiles declare their programs only with these
rules; the lint rejects b2's own `run`, `run-fail`, `compile`,
`compile-fail`, `exe` and `unit-test` there, by file and line.

```
import webcpp ;
webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 ;
webcpp.run          <name> : <sources> + : <requirements> * : <targets> * ;
webcpp.run-fail     <name> : <sources> + : <requirements> * : <targets> * ;
webcpp.compile      <name> : <sources> + : <requirements> * : <targets> * ;
webcpp.compile-fail <name> : <sources> + : <requirements> * : <targets> * ;
webcpp.example      <source> : <requirements> * : <targets> * ;
webcpp.headers-alone <library> : <include-root> ;
```

| Rule | Passes when | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `webcpp.targets t ...` | | the Jamfile's default targets; before its first program, once; each is `native`, `emscripten`, `wasip2` or `wasip3`, or the build stops naming it |
| `webcpp.run` | the program exits with 0 | natively, also built and run as `<name>-noexcept`, without exceptions and RTTI |
| `webcpp.run-fail` | the program exits with another status | |
| `webcpp.compile` | the sources compile | no program is linked |
| `webcpp.compile-fail` | the sources do not compile | left out of clang-tidy |
| `webcpp.example` | the program's standard output, carriage returns removed, equals `<stem>.expected` beside it | run through `testing.launcher` for wasm, by `tools/example/run_example.py`; always run again |
| `webcpp.headers-alone` | each public header compiles alone | one test per header, `alone-<path>` with `/` as `-` (`alone-xactor-scheduler`), against `/webcpp/<library>//<library>` |

The rules of the doc Jamfiles are in chapter 8: `webcpp.doc <library> :
<page>.adoc ;`, `webcpp.reference <library> ;` and, for the superproject's
index, `webcpp.index <page>.adoc ;`.

A library's Jamfiles, as xactor's, each whole after its licence notice.
`libs/xactor/test/Jamfile`:

```
project : requirements <library>/webcpp/xactor//xactor ;

import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 ;

webcpp.headers-alone xactor : ../include ;

# xactor's guarantees, one program per file, each also built natively as
# <name>-noexcept, without exceptions and without RTTI. scheduler checks the
# Asio driver where drivers.hpp declares it, outside WASI.
webcpp.run scheduler : scheduler_test.cpp ;
webcpp.run lifecycle : lifecycle_test.cpp ;
webcpp.run fuel : fuel_test.cpp ;
webcpp.run create_actor : create_actor_test.cpp ;
```

`libs/xactor/example/Jamfile`:

```
project : requirements <library>/webcpp/xactor//xactor ;

import webcpp ;

webcpp.targets native wasip2 wasip3 ;

webcpp.example xactor_quick_start.cpp ;
webcpp.example xactor_lifecycle.cpp ;
webcpp.example xactor_fuel.cpp ;
webcpp.example xactor_timers.cpp ;
webcpp.example xactor_drivers.cpp ;
# A test of actors, with lightweight_test: it prints nothing on its standard
# output, and returns boost::report_errors().
webcpp.example xactor_testing.cpp ;
# A static actor, whose behaviour is a Boost.MSM state machine.
webcpp.example xactor_msm.cpp ;
# Native only: Boost.Asio 1.92 does not compile for wasm32-wasip2 or
# wasm32-wasip3 with wasi-sdk 34 (no ESHUTDOWN, no ::pause, and a signal.h
# that stops with #error), so drivers.hpp declares asio_driver only outside
# WASI.
webcpp.example xactor_asio.cpp : : native ;
```

### Tests

- Unit tests use Boost.Core's lightweight_test,
  `<boost/core/lightweight_test.hpp>`, declared with `webcpp.run`. `main`
  runs the cases and returns `boost::report_errors()`.
- A case that cannot go on after a failed check returns:
  `if (!BOOST_TEST(x.has_value())) { return; }`. A helper, which cannot
  return from its case, calls `require(BOOST_TEST(...))`, which ends the
  program with the errors counted so far
  (`libs/xactor/test/require.hpp`): a test may be built without exceptions.
- Boost.Test only for a test that needs it (fixtures, data-driven suites).
  Such a test is declared with the targets `native` only.
- Every test runs on every target its Jamfile declares. What a target cannot
  build is excluded by declaration (`: native`), and inside a program by the
  same condition the library uses (`#ifndef __wasi__`), never by skipping
  silently.
- A test moved from the original's or another suite records the conversion,
  case by case, and each converted case is seen failing on a planted defect
  where the old one had a pinning test (`libs/xactor/test/CONVERSION.md`).

### Lanes

A lane builds and runs one library's tests and examples for one toolset, from
scratch, and records what it built and ran:

```
b2 -a --dump-tests --out-xml=<lane>.xml toolset=<toolset> libs/<library>/test libs/<library>/example
```

A wasip2 or wasip3 lane adds `testing.launcher=wasmtime`, which applies to
every toolset of one b2 request, so a lane is always one toolset. The lane
runs from the superproject's root. `--dump-tests` is required: it lists every
test, those the lane skips included, and the report refuses a file without
it. With `--out-xml`, b2 exits 0 even when a test fails, so b2's status is
never the verdict.

**Lane names.** A lane is named after its target (`native`, `emscripten`,
`wasip2`, `wasip3`) or after the directory b2 builds its toolset in
(`gcc-14`, `gcc-15`, `clang-linux-18`, `clang-darwin-21`, `msvc-14.3`). The
CI names a native lane after its directory, and a wasm or emscripten lane
after its target. The report checks every name against the toolset directory
the file records: a lane named after a target must be built for it, and any
other name must be that directory, or the report exits 2, naming the lane,
the directory and the two names it may take. A lane that built nothing
records no directory; its name is not checked, and it fails as empty.

**Lanes in parallel.** Independent lanes run at the same time, each with its
own build directory, and are read once all have finished:

```
b2 -a --dump-tests --build-dir=bin/lane-wasip2 --out-xml=wasip2.xml toolset=clang-wasip2 testing.launcher=wasmtime libs/<library>/test libs/<library>/example
```

Two concurrent b2 runs never share a build directory, and at most one of
them builds the documentation (chapter 8).

### The report (`tools/report/`)

```
python3 tools/report/report.py --lane <lane>=<lane>.xml [--lane ...] --out <dir>
```

writes the test matrix into `<dir>`: `index.html`, the libraries by lanes;
`<library>.html`, a library's tests and examples by lanes; and
`output/<lane>/...`, the log of each failure, linked from its cell. A cell is
green when every build of it passed, red with the kind of its most
significant failure (compile, compiled, link, linked, build, run, ran, not
run), and grey (n/a) when the lane did not build it.

**Its exit status is the verdict:** 0 when every lane built something (a test
or an example: an example counts as something that ran) and everything
passed; 1 when a test or an example failed, an action outside every test
failed, or a lane built nothing, each named; 2, with nothing written, when a
file cannot be read, a lane spans more than one toolset, a lane named after a
target was built for another, a lane named after no target is not named after
its toolset directory, a test lies outside `libs/<name>/`, or a library is
named `index`.

### CI

Pending (Task 11): none of this is in the tree yet. It runs exactly the
commands above.

**A library's CI,** `libs/<name>/.github/workflows/ci.yml`, calls the
superproject's reusable workflow `.github/workflows/library.yml`
(`on: workflow_call`, input `library`):

- it checks out `webcpporg/webcpp` with its submodules, then the calling
  library's commit into `libs/<library>`;
- a `plan` job runs `b2 declared-targets -d0` and emits a JSON matrix of the
  library's lanes: the CI never lists a library's targets by hand;
- the lane jobs follow it:
  - native: Linux GCC 14 and 15, Linux Clang 18 and 22 on libstdc++, macOS
    Apple Clang, Windows MSVC 14.3 and 14.5. The Clang lanes on libstdc++
    stay: a regression of xactor's guarantee 28 is caught only there;
  - `wasip2` and `wasip3`, with wasi-sdk 34 and wasmtime 47.0.3, both
    blocking;
  - `emscripten`, only when the library declares it;
- each lane runs the lane command and uploads its XML;
- a `docs` job builds `libs/<library>/doc`, with MrDocs on Linux x86-64
  (MrDocs has no build for Linux arm64 or Intel macOS) and clang++;
- a `lint` job runs the lint in four shards (`--shard 1/4` to `4/4`), with
  Node and the full history (`fetch-depth: 0`), since the banned-word rule
  reads every commit;
- a `report` job merges every lane's XML with `tools/report/report.py`; its
  exit status is the CI's verdict.

actionlint checks every workflow, as a job of the CI ported from xstate-cpp's,
and runs clean on `.github/workflows/` before a workflow change is committed.

**The Boost action,** `tools/ci/actions/boost/`, downloads
`boost_1_92_0.tar.bz2` from `https://archives.boost.io/release/1.92.0/source/`
(its SHA-256 recorded in the action), builds and installs it to a cached
prefix, writes the `using boost` line, and installs the b2 of that release, on
Linux, macOS and Windows. The other actions install wasi-sdk, wasmtime,
MrDocs and Node. Every third-party action is pinned by its full commit SHA,
with its tag in a comment.

**The superproject's CI,** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, runs the same lanes
over every library at the commits its submodules point to, then the docs of
every library and the index, then the report. On `main` it deploys to GitHub
Pages, `https://webcpporg.github.io/webcpp/`: `index.html` (the index page),
`libs/<name>/` (each library's page) and `report/` (the test matrix).
Submodules are bumped by pull request, merged only when green; `main` is the
only branch.

## 10. Process

- **The specification before the code, a failing test before the
  implementation.** A behaviour is written down (in the page, or in the
  library's `AGENTS.md` for what is internal) before it is built, and a test
  is seen failing before the code that makes it pass.
- **A defect is first reproduced the way a user meets it:** the command a
  user runs, the page a reader opens, the lane CI runs. Then it is fixed, and
  the reproduction becomes a test.
- **Only a build from scratch counts as evidence:** `b2 -a`. b2 compares
  timestamps, and an incremental build can leave a stale result in place. An
  incremental build is for iterating.
- **Green, before any merge,** means all of these, run and read, not assumed:
  - every declared lane from scratch: `b2 -a libs/<name>/test
    libs/<name>/example` natively, and with `toolset=clang-wasip2
    testing.launcher=wasmtime` and `toolset=clang-wasip3
    testing.launcher=wasmtime` where declared;
  - `b2 -a doc`;
  - the lint: `lint: clean`;
  - the tests of the build and of the tools, when they or what they test
    changed: `tools/test/jamroot_test.py`, `tools/test/webcpp_jam_test.py`,
    `tools/test/doc_test.py`, `tools/lint/lint_test.py`,
    `tools/report/report_test.py`, `tools/doc/doc_check_test.py`,
    `tools/doc/doc_comments_test.py`, `tools/doc/extensions_test.py` and
    `tools/example/run_example_test.py`, each run as
    `python3 <path>`. They build in scratch copies under `$TMPDIR`, whose
    path holds a space, so they run beside a build of the tree;
  - CI green: Pending (Task 11).
- **Fix the lint, the failures and the flakiness you meet,** even when they
  are not yours; report what you cannot fix.
- **A change of the build or of a tool** has a test that fails without it:
  the tests of `tools/` pin every behaviour this file states. A change to
  b2's `--out-xml` format shows as a red `report_test.py`, whose samples are
  recorded, never edited by hand (`python3 tools/report/record_samples.py`).

### Porting a library, step by step

1. Choose it, check its licence, and pin its version (chapter 2).
2. Make `libs/<name>` with its checklist files (chapter 2), and see `b2
   libs/<name>/test` build the headers-alone tests of an empty convenience
   header.
3. Port the original's tests as cases, and the oracle that writes their
   expected results from the pinned original (chapter 5); see them fail.
4. Port the code, header by header, with its Doc Comments (chapter 7), until
   the cases pass natively, then on every declared target.
5. Write the page: the guide with its examples and twins, the guarantees,
   the testing chapter, the reference and the differences (chapters 4, 8).
6. Run the definition of green above, from scratch.

## 11. Commits and text

- **Identity.** Commits are made as `Rodrigo <pinhopro@proton.me>`, with no
  trailer of any kind (no `Co-authored-by`, no `Signed-off-by`, no agent
  name):

  ```
  git -c user.name=Rodrigo -c user.email=pinhopro@proton.me commit -- <paths>
  ```

  Stage and commit with explicit paths, never `git add -A`. A subject is
  plain: what the change does, prefixed by the part it touches
  (`tools/doc: ...`, `xactor: ...`).
- **No accidental trailer.** git reads a last body paragraph that starts with
  `word:` as a trailer (`std::` does). Start such a paragraph otherwise.
- **English** in everything written to a file: code, comments, documents,
  commit messages.
- **No em dash** (U+2014) anywhere; use a plain dash.
- **The banned word.** No file, file name or commit mentions the word that
  `veru[s]` matches, in any case: `git grep -I -i -e 'veru[s]'` prints
  nothing in any repository, and the lint checks every commit's author,
  committer and message too.
- **The licence notice.** Every source file (`.hpp`, `.cpp`, `.py`, `.mjs`,
  `.sh`, `.jam`, `Jamroot`, `Jamfile`, `build.jam`, `.yml`) opens with it,
  with `#` for Jam, Python, shell and YAML; a `#!` line stays first:

  ```
  // Copyright (c) 2026 WebCpp.org
  //
  // Distributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0. (See
  // accompanying file LICENSE_1_0.txt or copy at
  // https://www.boost.org/LICENSE_1_0.txt)
  ```

  An AsciiDoc file opens with it too, as `//` comments.
- **History.** Every repository starts from one import commit; the history of
  the code it was moved from is not carried over.
- **Outward actions** belong to the owner: no push, no merge, no remote
  repository created, no GitHub setting changed, no SSH key or credential
  touched by an agent.

## 12. b2 facts

Each of these was measured; each has cost time.

- **Every b2 run unsets `CPATH`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` and `C_INCLUDE_PATH`.**
  A shell that sets them (Homebrew's often does) makes the compiler read
  another Boost before the configured one, without a word; the Jamroot
  refuses to run while one is set:

  ```
  env -u CPATH -u CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH -u C_INCLUDE_PATH b2 ...
  ```

- **A verdict is built from scratch,** `b2 -a`: b2 compares timestamps, and
  an edit in the same second as the last build is missed.
- **`$(` inside an action is b2's, not the shell's.** b2 expands `$(name)` in
  an action's text, so a shell `$(command)` silently becomes empty; write
  command substitution with backquotes.
- **An action of more than one command opens with `set -e`,** or a failing
  command in its middle goes unnoticed.
- **`<build>no` is conditioned on the toolset,** never on a derived feature
  such as `<target-os>`: b2's evaluation of conditional requirements then
  never settles, since `<build>no` replaces every other conditional result,
  `<target-os>wasi` among them.
- **A syntax error in a Jamfile only prints,** and every target declared
  after it silently stops existing. When a target is "not found", read the
  first lines of b2's output.
- **A subproject's target is named with its project:** `b2
  libs/xactor/test//scheduler`, `b2 libs/xactor/doc//reference`.
- **`testing.launcher` applies to every toolset of one request,** so a wasm
  lane and a native one are two b2 runs.
- **With `--out-xml`, b2 exits 0 even when a test fails;** the report's exit
  status is the verdict, and the report needs `--dump-tests`.
- **b2 5.5.3's `--command-database` writes nothing,** so the compilation
  database comes from `tools/lint/compile_commands.py`, which reads b2's dry
  run (`b2 -n -a`).
- **A free feature plays no part in a target's build directory:** an
  example's output from one launcher would read as up to date under another,
  which is why `webcpp.example` always runs again.
- **wasm32-wasip2 and wasm32-wasip3 are no system b2 knows.** The Jamroot
  adds the `<target-os>wasi` value after the toolsets are loaded, so that gcc's
  Unix link options (`--start-group`, `-Bstatic`, rpath), which
  wasm-component-ld rejects, are never chosen for it.
- **Boost's location.** `boost.use-project` takes the `using boost` of
  `user-config.jam`, else `BOOST_ROOT`, else the compiler's default paths.
  Apple's clang searches `/usr/local/include` before every `-isystem`
  directory, so clang keeps Boost's directory as `-I` and marks the headers
  `<boost/...>` names as system ones (`--system-header-prefix=boost/`).
- **A checkout path that holds a space** builds: every path b2 hands to an
  action is quoted, and the tests of the build run in such a path.
